# Power-Bi-360-Dashboard
 Business Insights 360 – Power BI Project
Welcome to Business Insights 360, a complete Business Intelligence project I created as part of the Codebasics Power BI Course. This project simulates a real-world scenario where the fictional company AtliQ uses data to recover from poor decisions and drive business growth through insights.

🧠 Problem Statement
AtliQ faced big losses while expanding into the Latin American market due to decisions based on gut feeling and unstructured data. Meanwhile, competitors using data-driven strategies succeeded. To turn things around, AtliQ hired a data analytics team to use structured data for smarter planning, better decisions, and performance tracking.

📌 Project Summary
This project includes:

✅ A clean, optimized Power BI data model
✅ 5 fully interactive dashboards
✅ KPIs to track finance, sales, supply chain, and marketing performance
✅ Tools used: Power BI, SQL, Excel
